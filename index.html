    <H2 style="color: black;">Jhleum is a city on the east bank of the Jhelum River, which is located in the district of Jhelum in the north of Punjab province, Pakistan.
        It is the 44th largest city of Pakistan by population.
        Jhelum is known for providing many soldiers to the British Army before independence and later to the Pakistan armed forces due to which it is also known as City of Soldiers or Land of Martyrs and Warriors.
        Jhelum is a few miles upstream from the site of the ancient Battle of the Hydaspes between the armies of Alexander and King Porus. 
        Possibly Jhelum City was the capital of Porus' Kingdom, Paurava. 
        A city called Bucephala was founded nearby to commemorate the death of Alexander's horse, Bucephalus.
        Other notable sites nearby include the 16th-century Rohtas Fort, the Tilla Jogian complex of ancient temples, and the 16th-century Grand Trunk Road which passes through the city. 
        According to the 2017 census of Pakistan, the population of Jhelum was 190,425.
        The name of the city is derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow), as the water that flows through the river originates in the Himalayas. 
        There are a number of industries in and around Jhelum city, including a tobacco factory, wood, marble, glass and flour mills.</H2>
